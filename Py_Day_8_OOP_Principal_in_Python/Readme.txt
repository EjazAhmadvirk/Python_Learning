OOP has 4 main principles:

Encapsulation – Binding data (variables) and methods (functions) together in a class, and controlling access to them.

Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionality.

Inheritance – Reusing code by creating a new class from an existing one.

Polymorphism – Using the same method name for different tasks depending on the object.
